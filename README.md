#Spotify Clone - HTML & CSS

This repository contains a Spotify clone built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to recreate the look and feel of Spotifyâ€™s interface with a clean and minimal design approach. As of now, the homepage UI is complete, offering a close replica of Spotify's homepage, including interactive elements, album sections, and a fully designed audio player.

#ðŸŽ¨ Key Features
Homepage UI: A pixel-perfect recreation of Spotifyâ€™s homepage, featuring sections like Recently Played, Popular Albums, and Playlist & Podcast creation.

Interactive Audio Player UI: The bottom part of the screen contains a static but visually appealing mockup of Spotifyâ€™s music player. The player shows current track details, play/pause controls, progress bar, and volume control.

Albums and Playlists: Previews for Top 50 Global albums, with sections for creating new playlists and browsing podcasts.
